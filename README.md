OVERVIEW:

1. The aim of this is to train and test Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification on CIFAR10 dataset using PyTorch Module.

2. "wandb" has been used as a tool for monitoring the experiments involving different methods of training with different optimizers.

More details about the project can be found in "Details.pdf" file.
A detailed report, namely "Results.pdf", has all the relevant results of the experiment.

One can directly run these codes in local PC or export it to Google Colab or Jupyter.
